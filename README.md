# StationaryMileTracker

An app that helps users log how many miles they've ridden per day for the current month

Users can set a daily and monthly goal. With enough data collected, charts show how many miles per day along with an average rule line. 

Future updates to include:
- Log miles for multiple months. See history of months
- More expansive chart view with added statistics
- Animations to celebrate when daily/monthly goals are surpassed
- Notification reminders to encourage consistent routines

MVP will launch in app store in 2023.
